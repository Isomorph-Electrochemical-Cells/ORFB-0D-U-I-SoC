# ORFB-0D-U-I-SoC Model
The model allows to predict the cell voltage and power density of a single redox flow battery cell in terms of the applied current and state of charge of the battery.

**Features:**
* Efficient, physics-based model for the performance prediction of a single RFB cell
* Electro-osmotic drag accounts for solvent flow through the membrane
* Activation and concentration overpotentials
* Validated parameterization for the TEMPTMA/paraquat electrolyte system

**Main model inputs:**
* Electric current density
* State of charge
* Volumetric flow rate
* Initial electrolyte concentrations
* Cell geometry

**Main model outputs:**
* Total cell voltage
* Power of the cell
